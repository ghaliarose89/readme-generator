# README Generator
## Purpose: 
This is a command-line application that runs with Node.js that dynamically generates a README.md file based on input about your project
## Description :
Every project needs a quality README with information:
* about the app 
* what the app is for
* how to use the app
* how to install it
* how to report issues
* and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the       project. 

## Installation:
To generate your own README :

Run `npm install` in order to install the following npm package dependencies as specified in the `package.json`:
* [`inquirer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) will prompt you for your inputs from the command line.
The application will start by running `node index.js` in the command line.
Answer the prompts in your command line to generate the README.
After answering all the prompts, your README file will be named 'READMEExample.md' and will be ready for you at the root of the repo.

Check out the [`READMEExample.md`](https://github.com/ghaliarose89/readme-generator/blob/main/README.md) in this repo as an example.
